    History
    -------

        v2.51 : September 9th, 2000
        -----
                Assembler core :
                - added support for a new file format to the INCBIN directive,
                  INCBIN can now include '.fmp' map files created with the
                  mapper program Mappy.


        v2.50 : July 27th, 2000
        -----
                Assembler core :
                - fixed a few bugs here and there.
                - added a new predefined function SIZEOF that returns
                  the size of a data element (ex. included with #INCBIN)
                - added four experimental directives .proc/.endp,
                  and .procgroup/.endprocgroup; don't use them yet.


        v2.10 : January 22th, 1999
        -----
                Assembler core:
                - fixed a bug in backward branch code.
                - fixed a little bug in the expression parser.
                - merged the code of the NES and the PCE assembler, now
                  there's only one program.
                - made the code more portable; it can now be compiled
                  without any change on most Unix systems.
                - added '.byte' and '.word' directives (same as '.db' and
                  '.dw') for compatibility with other assemblers.
                - added a new command line switch, '-srec' to ouput a
                  Motorola S-record file (for EEPROM/EPROM programming).


        v2.01 : December 21th, 1998
        -----
                - minor update, fixed a litte bug in the bank code.


        v2.00 : December 19th, 1998
        -----
                - merged Charles Doty's NES assembler in MagicKit, which add
                  NES support to MagicKit. :)
                - added a version of .defchr and .incchr directives adapted
                  to the NES.


        v0.10 : May 4th, 1998
        -----
                - removed all the HuC6820 opcodes.
                - added four directives to support the INES file format
                  (inesprg, ineschr, inesmap, inesmir).
